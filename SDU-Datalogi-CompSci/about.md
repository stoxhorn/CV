SDU projects

During my computer science studies i developed the following projects:

Java:
https://github.com/stoxhorn/CSGOSQL
https://github.com/stoxhorn/Concurrent
https://github.com/stoxhorn/Compression
https://github.com/stoxhorn/SpilTeori

C:
https://github.com/stoxhorn/dm510_module

Assembly:
https://github.com/stoxhorn/Architecture


**SpilTeori** - https://github.com/stoxhorn/SpilTeori
SpilTeori means Gametheory. This project was a yearly project where we had a lot of freedom to choose what we wanted to do. In this project we first developed the game Tic-Tac-Toe, and then an AI, that would always make the optimal choice in the game.

Although i had only known how to program for less than a year at this point, i already knew a bit about agile principles, as my mom has been a Project Manager and Scrum master, and from the series "Silicon Valley". During this project i got experience with actually implementing it. It didn't take more than a few hours, and everyone else already had a tunnel vision on some code they were building, and nobody was talking or communicating. Since the others were also inexperienced, i decided to do something similar, but instead i'd make an interface in Java.

The next day, i used the interface i'd made, to introduce the idea of delegating the various functions between us. Which is why the project contains an interface, that is only implemented once. It worked really well.
