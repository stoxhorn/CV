#SDU projects

During my computer science studies i developed the following projects:

Java:

https://github.com/stoxhorn/Concurrent

https://github.com/stoxhorn/Compression

https://github.com/stoxhorn/SpilTeori

C:

https://github.com/stoxhorn/OS3


Assembly:

https://github.com/stoxhorn/Architecture


**SpilTeori** - https://github.com/stoxhorn/SpilTeori
SpilTeori means Gametheory. This project was a yearly project where we had a lot of freedom to choose what we wanted to do. In this project we first developed the game Tic-Tac-Toe, and then an AI, that would always make the optimal choice in the game.

Although i had only known how to program for less than a year at this point, i already knew a bit about agile principles, as my mom has been a Project Manager and Scrum master, and from the series "Silicon Valley". During this project i got experience with actually implementing it. It didn't take more than a few hours, and everyone else already had a tunnel vision on some code they were building, and nobody was talking or communicating. Since the others were also inexperienced, i decided to do something similar, but instead i'd make an interface in Java.

The next day, i used the interface i'd made, to introduce the idea of delegating the various functions between us. Which is why the project contains an interface, that is only implemented once. It worked really well.

**Architecture** - https://github.com/stoxhorn/Architecture
In this project i had to create a sorting algorithm in Assembly, that would sort numbers in a text file and give a new sorted file as output.

**Operating Systems - Driver** - https://github.com/stoxhorn/dm510_module
In this project, i created a driver in kernel space, that was able to read input from hardware.

**Operating Systems - Filesystem** - https://github.com/stoxhorn/OS3
In this project i had to create an entire filesystem, using memory. My implementation would read the entire disk once, and store the entire thing in memory, until it needs to save data. If the system does not close naturally, no changes are saved. The repository includes the report, that describes how the filesystem works. One unique aspect of my implementation, was EVERY folder having it's own ID, and as such you could very swiftly move to specific Directories.

FUSE was used for this project.


**Java and SQL** - https://github.com/stoxhorn/CSGOSQL
Java project where i learned to connect to pgsql

**Java Conccurency** - https://github.com/stoxhorn/Concurrent/
This project was about using concurrency, and was given as files to fill out.

**Java and Compression** - https://github.com/stoxhorn/Compression
Here i implemented compression algorithms in Java.
