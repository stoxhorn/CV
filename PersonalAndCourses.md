## Web3


**Token Sniper** - https://github.com/stoxhorn/Sniper
This was a python project to buy a token pancakeswap, as soon as it was listed. It didn't have a frontend, and used the terminal for input.
When i created this, i had never used Javascript, and Javascript was/is the preferred language to use for web3, and there weren't really any libraries for this in Java. It was built for one usecase only, and it worked for that. But it wasn't built to handle many Decentralized exchanges, and therefore i hadn't put much thought into interfaces. But i learned a lot by working on this project, and started planning a better one shortly after in Python as well.

It's here, and consists mostly of Diagrams and plans/ideas: https://github.com/stoxhorn/DFT-DeFi-Trader

**Javascript version** - https://github.com/stoxhorn/DefiTrader
Later when i learned Javascript, i restarted the Idea, but this time with a frontend, that can just do some simple stuff. As i've gotten a lot of experience and confidence, i want to do this one thoroughly, when i have time to give it some proper thought and not just code away for the sake of functionality. This is also what i'm planning to use, to get experience with working with web3. This uses Ethers.JS
