# CV


## SDU-Datalogi-CompSci
In 2017 i started as a student on a Bachelor in Computer Science. This was very theoretical, and i enjoyed that. But i really felt i was lacking, as when i wanted to do something personal, i really felt like i could do *part* of a program, but i had no clue where to start and where to end, if i wanted to create a full product.

## CBS-Datamatiker-SE
I started on this programme in 2020, and it revolves around project work, and learning to develop a full product as a team, using agile methods. Here we used Java, and i gained a lot of valueable experience and this made me feel ready to start my career.

## PersonalAndCourses
While studying, i've spend some time on personal projects, the one i actually used was https://github.com/stoxhorn/Sniper, where i built a working token sniper for use on PancakeSwap on BSC. 

I've also liked doing online courses. At first i was engrossed in learning C++ through game development in Unreal Engine. I never finished it, and learned a lot about how i learn things myself, as it moved too slow for me. As it involved Unreal Engine and large directories, i don't have any repositores for this.

Smart Contracts, DeFi and Web3 has captivated me a lot, and made me start on the courses on Calyptus.co. I expected there to be more exercises, and got a bit let down, but i've been satisfying my exercise needs on smartcontract.engineer.
