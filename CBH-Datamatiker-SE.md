# CBS Projects

At CBS the study programme was more focused on how to program as a team, and to create a final finished product. It revolved around planning, designing and implementing. But more importantly, we were given tools and projects to gain experience from.

**Carport** - https://github.com/stoxhorn/Carport
The final project was done by our teacher finding a shop, and having them be the client. It was shop, that sold DIY carports. We had to make a website, that allowed customers to order a carport, with custom sizes. Then we had to calculate the specific materials and parts, based on an example order, along with a realistic drawing, made using SVG.

I was responsible for the SVG, database CRUD, and the control that handled the frontend input.

Here is a video demonstrating the result: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ8yg-a-sLc


**Cupcake Shop** - https://github.com/stoxhorn/cupcake
A project to create a cupcake shop, where one can order different types of Cupcakes. there is a video demonstrating the project in use. A secondary repository contains the written Danish hand-in: https://github.com/stoxhorn/cupcake2/blob/main/other/aflevering.pdf

**Sauna booking** - https://github.com/stoxhorn/sauna/tree/main/sauna
Next up was a project with a frontend, for booking times for a sauna. Here we used Java, Javadservlets and JSP for frontend.

**Table Football** - https://github.com/stoxhorn/SP3
Here we created a database, and a connection to the database. We didn't create any frontend yet. But we spent time on planning, using a KanBan board and drawing Diagrams.
